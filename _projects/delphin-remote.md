The Delphin Remote app allowed users to wirelessly transmit their Delphin's screen to their smartphone, allowing for a greater area of control and easier typing.

While this feature was fun to create and taught me a lot about networking, we could never make it as user-friendly as it needed to be and it was the most frequent reason for customer service calls. We deprecated the Remote in favor of building the custom Keyboard, which addressed the same issues without the need for connecting to a phone.
