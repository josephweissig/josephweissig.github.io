The Lap Tracking Companion app was our first attempt at displaying the data gathered from the Delphin, since the Delphin's form factor didn't allow for easy browsing.

The Companion app provided the bare essentials for displaying the data, but setup was cumbersome and confusing, and very few customers used it.

In 2020, I redesigned the app to more seamlessly gather data from the Delphin and display it in a user-friendly interface, but the refactor was shelved due to other priorities.
