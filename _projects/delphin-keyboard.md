Originally, the Delphin shipped with the standard AOSP QWERTY keyboard, but based on user feedback, we developed a brand-new keyboard for precision text input on a small screen.

The Delphin Keyboard has a single row of large keys, with buttons or sliding gestures to move along the alphabet, making it easy to select the letter you want.

While this method of input does slow down typing speed, most text entered on the Delphin are usernames or passwords, which require accuracy over speed.
